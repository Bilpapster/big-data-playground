\section{Introduction}

The current document is a technical report for the first programming assignment in the M.Sc. course on \emph{Technologies for Big Data Analysis}, offered by the \emph{DWS M.Sc Program}\footnote{https://dws.csd.auth.gr/} of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The course is taught by Professor Apostolos Papadopoulos~\footnote{https://datalab-old.csd.auth.gr/$\sim$apostol/}. The authors attended the course during their first year of Ph.D. studies at the Institution.

The assignment contains 4 sub-problems and is part of a series, comprising 3 programming assignments on the following topics:
\begin{description}
  \item[Assignment 1] Multi-threading Programming and Inter-Process Communication
  \item[Assignment 2] The Map-Reduce Programming Paradigm
  \item[Assignment 3] Big Data Analytics with Scala and Apache Spark
\end{description}
In this document we focus on Assignment 1 and its 4 sub-problems. We refer to them as \emph{problems} in the rest of the document for simplicity. The source code of our solution has been made available at \texttt{\small https://github.com/ Bilpapster/big-data-playground}.

\textbf{Roadmap}.
The rest of our work is structured as follows. We devote one section for each one of the 4 problems. That means problems 1, 2, 3 and 4 are presented in sections \ref{section:problem1}, \ref{section:problem2}, \ref{section:problem3} and \ref{section:problem4} respectively. For each problem, we first provide the problem statement, as given by the assignment. Next, we thoroughly present the reasoning and/or methodology we have adopted to approach the problem and devise a solution. Wherever applicable, we also provide insights about the source code implementation we have developed. For problems 2 and 4, we complete the respective sections with a discussion about alternatives or improvements the solution could accept, in order to successfully support more complex requirements. Finally, we conclude our work in section \ref{section:conclusion}.

\section{Problem 1: Concurrent Array-Vector Multiplication}
\label{section:problem1}
We discuss here the first problem of the assignment. The main target of the assignment is using multi-threading programming in Java programming language to concurrently perform an algebraic operation.
\subsection{Problem Statement}
It is known that in Linear Algebra we can multiply a matrix with a vector from the right-hand side, provided that the number of columns in the matrix equals the number of rows in the vector. For instance, given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with dimensions $n~\times~m$ and a vector $v$ with dimensions $m~\times~1$, then the product $\mathbf{A}*\mathbf{v}$ is an $n~\times~1$ vector, which results from the implementation of the well-known method of multiplying a matrix with a vector. An example is given following: \todo

Provided that we are capable of using $k$ threads, where $k$ is a power of 2 and the matrix has dimensions $n~\times~m$, where $n$ is also a power of 2 and $n>k$, design a solution that computes the product $\mathbf{A}*\mathbf{v}$ using $k$ threads with the most efficient way. Your solution has to initialize both the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the vector $\mathbf{v}$ with random numbers in the range $[0, 10]$.

\section{Problem 2: Race against a pandemic}
\label{section:problem2}
This is the section for the second problem.
\subsection{Problem Statement}

\section{Problem 3: Key-value server store}
\label{section:problem3}
This is the section for the third problem.
\subsection{Problem Statement}

\section{Problem 4: Multi-server producer-consumer interaction}
\label{section:problem4}
This is the section for the fourth problem.
\subsection{Problem Statement}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
This is the section for the conclusion.
