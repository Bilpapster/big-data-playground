# Big Data Playground

## Introduction

Welcome to our Big Data Analytics Exploration repository!

This repository is a collaborative effort with my colleague at [Datalab AUTh](https://github.com/Datalab-Csd-Auth), [Christos Balaktsis](https://github.com/balaktsis). Over the past weeks, we have developed solutions to a variety of big data analytics problems. Our work encompasses:

- **Parallel Programming in Java**
- **MapReduce Solutions in Java & Apache Hadoop**
- **Scalable Distributed Solutions in Apache Spark & Scala**

---

## 1. Parallel Programming

The first area of our big data exploration focuses on **multithreading programming in Java**. We implemented various algorithms to leverage parallelism and improve performance in data processing tasks. Key aspects include:

- **Concurrency Control**: Implementing mechanisms to manage thread synchronization and avoid race conditions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizing multithreading to enhance the efficiency of data processing.

For more detailed information on our implementations and the concurrency control techniques used, please refer to the [Parallel Programming Report](https://github.com/Bilpapster/big-data-playground/blob/main/Multi-threading-and-inter-process-communication/report/main.pdf). The source code can be found under the `./Multi-threading-and-inter-process-communication/` directory.

## 2. MapReduce Programming Paradigm

The second area explores the **MapReduce programming paradigm** using Apache Hadoop. We focused on distributed processing in Java to handle large datasets efficiently. This section includes source code for:

- **Movie Analytics**: Processing structured data related to movies.
- **Graph Analytics**: Implementing algorithms for large-scale graph data.
- **Text Processing**: Handling unstructured text data.

We worked with both **structured data** (e.g., movie analytics) and **unstructured data** (e.g., text processing) to demonstrate the versatility of MapReduce in different contexts.

For a comprehensive overview of our MapReduce implementations, please refer to the [MapReduce Programming Report](https://github.com/Bilpapster/big-data-playground/blob/main/map-reduce/report/main.pdf). The source code can be found under the `./map-reduce/` directory.

## 3. Scalable Distributed Programming

The final section focuses on **scalable distributed programming** using **Scala** and **Apache Spark**. We harnessed Spark's powerful computing framework for distributed processing. This section includes solutions for:

- **Graph Analytics**: Advanced processing of large graph datasets.
- **Movie Analytics**: Analyzing movie data using Spark's RDDs and DataFrames.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performing sentiment analysis on text data.
- **Text Processing**: Efficiently processing and analyzing large text datasets.

We utilized both **RDDs** and **DataFrames** in Apache Spark to demonstrate different approaches to big data processing.

For detailed insights into our Spark implementations, please refer to the [Spark Programming Report](https://github.com/Bilpapster/big-data-playground/blob/main/spark/report/main.pdf). The source code can be found under the `./spark/` directory.

## Getting Started

To explore our work:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilpapster/big-data-playground.git
2. Navigate to the desired section's directory.
3. Refer to the  `report/main.pdf` within that directory for a comprehensive overview of the implementation. These files also contain instructions, should you wish to set up and run the code.
